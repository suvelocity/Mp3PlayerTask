# MP3 Player - Second Weekend Assignment

## What I Learned From This Assignment
1. About Arrays and Objects and how access them.
2. Create my own function to get the job done.
3. Regex
4. Work with tests and how to know what the tester wants from me.

## What i can improve
- Learn more about Objects and how to use them correctly.
- Write the less code for the same purpose.
- Write less messy code.


## Important
I changed the test file cebause i think the default behavior of the duration arguments it is seconds and not MM:SS format, although it can deal with the right string MM:SS format. 


Have fun going thourgh my code!
