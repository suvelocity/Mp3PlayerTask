# MP3 Player

## A little about the work
As part of a Cyber4s course, we were inspired to create an Mp3 player, using JavaScript Vanilla.
We were first given basic functions that affect the printer or print from it, and with them we had to start working.
Of course for readable and orderly code it is important to add more functions, and so I did.
It was important to pay attention and identify the errors that could be, like trying to create a playlist with an ID that was already in use, or getting to a song that did not exist, I prevented this by throwing intentional errors.
At work I learned about effective and correct use of Google, proper use can save us a lot of precious time.
In addition, I also learned about new functions that can be run on strings, arrays, and objects.
I feel much more professional in JavaScript after this task, and sure it's just the beginning.

## On me
I am Amit Fikler, 22 years old, living in Even Yehuda in Israel. And I am a student in the Precourse of CYBER4S. So far we have learned HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT.
The full course is designed for students to become fullstock programmers.
